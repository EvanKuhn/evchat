# evchat
Curses-based chat app.

Since this is my first Python app, it's meant for learning.

So far the app just takes input and displays it on the screen. I'm basically just getting to know the curses library. There is a lot more to do to have it connect to a server and actually funciton like a chat app.

Usage:
- To open the app, run `./bin/evchat`
- To exit cleanly, type `/quit`
